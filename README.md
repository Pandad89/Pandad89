ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adam Birnbaum. I'm a junior full stack developer. My tech stack is MongoDB, Express, React and Node or MERN for short.<br><br>
Iâ€™m near the end of a full stack boot camp I've been part of for the last 6 months and am currently job hunting, while I work on my coding skills in the meantime.<br><br>
My daily operating system is linux, specifically Manjaro Linux. All of the repos I've uploaded have been coded using vscode on linux mint and manjaro linux.<br><br>
I enjoy  coding, learning, video games and many more...<br><br>
