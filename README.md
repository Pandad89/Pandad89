ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pandad. My name is a mix of Panda (my nickname) and Dad (my title). I'm not pan...<br><br>
Iâ€™m interested in games, computers and other stuff I'm having trouble thinking of right now.<br><br>
currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript & Linux.<br><br>
Since I'm new here, I don't think I'll ask for help, since I try to understand new things on my own. Hopefully I'll get the hang of this platform and will open up to messages soon.
